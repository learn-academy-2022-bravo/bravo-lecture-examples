# Intro to GitHub

## Bravo's first GitHub adventure

### Git Process
- Create a repo
- Clone the repo - there is a repo on GitHub and you need it locally
  - Local/locally - your computer
  - Remote - cloud, GitHub, on the internet
- Make a file - touch a new file
  - Make sure you are inside the repo
  - Naming conventions - lowercase, no spaces
  - Extension - what file type, what language
  - .md - markdown
- Added some content
- Added PAT authentication
- Local --> remote
  - git status
  - git add .
  - git commit -m "message"  (goal of message: human communication)
  - git push origin main (not always main)


### Useful Git Commands
```
git add .
git commit -m "something that is helpful to future me"
git push origin main
```

### Useful Terminal Commands
```
ls - lists all the content of the current directory
touch - makes a new file
cd <name> - change directory into another nested folder/directory
cd .. - moves back one level, moves one level close to the root
```

### Best Git Command Ever
```
git status
```
