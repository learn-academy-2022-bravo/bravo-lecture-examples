# White Boarding 3/31/2022

White boarding is one of many styles of technical interviews. It is often considered the most nerve wracking styles of interviews.

You WILL be nervous. That is a given.


### Guidelines and Best Practices
- Communication!!!
- Make sure you understand the problem - write it out
- Establish a test input and output
- Think out loud
- Ask questions!

### Our Thursday White Boarding
- Three questions - one standard interview question, two technical questions
- One code prompt - in a markdown or text file

Prompt:
```
Create a function that takes in a string of multiple words
If the word is 5 or more letters reverse the word
Less than 5 leave as is

"hey there bravo"
"hey ereht ovarb"

create a function - reverseIfFiveOrMore
parameter - string
split string on the spaces ["hey", "there", "bravo"]
iterate
if length less than 5, return word
if 5 or longer reverse - split, reverse, join ["hey", "ereht", "ovarb"]
join the array on the spaces
```
