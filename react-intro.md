A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

### Vocab
- Library - collection of code snippets that can be used as a set
- node_modules - bits of code logic
- yarn - JavaScript package manager

### React
Scale/scaleability - ability to have more users
Facebook created React - reusable code, efficient code

### Reusable Code
- Components - can be a class or a function, we are going to focus on classes for an object-oriented approach to programming
- Components have to be instantiated and can be instantiated as many times as needed

### Efficient Code
- Virtual DOM - identify which tags are affected in a user interaction, diff - isolates only the tags that are affected to update
- DOM - Document Object Model, visual representation of a webpage


JSX - markup language, a blend of HTML and JavaScript, mostly behaves like HTML
<></> - React fragment
